inputs
*********
PEPPA takes GFF3 files as input. You can use a single GFF3 file if the file contains nucleotide sequences at the end of the file, or append a separate file of nucleotide sequences after the GFF file. Both files can either be in plain text or in GZIP format. 

Input files from Prokka
=======================
The GFF3 files generated by Prokka can be used as inputs for PEPPA without modification. 

Input files from GenBank or RefSeq
===================================
The GFF3 files from GenBank or RefSeq only contain annotation and no nucleotide sequences. Thus a separate file of nucleotide sequences need to be appended after the GFF3 file, after a comma. For example, use

::
  GCF_000006785.2_ASM678v2_genomic.gff.gz,GCF_000006785.2_ASM678v2_genomic.fna.gz

as an input for the `Streptococcus pyogenes M1 GAS <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000006785.2/>`_ genome.

Note: you do not need to modify either of these two files because PEPPA uses the GZIPped files by default.
